# file-handlers
Python scripts to handle files and directories

## FileNameGrouper
This script takes a directory of similarly named files, groups them by their names, and copies the groups of files to different directories.  The script takes 2 input parameters - the source directory and the target directory.  A sample files directory is provided as the source directory to parse (the code is hard-coded specifically for this source directory).

Disclaimer: This script was written as a practice exercise to learn the basics of the Python syntax and code structure.
